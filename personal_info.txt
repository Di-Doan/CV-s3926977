My name is Doan Thien Di. My birthday is September 15th, 2003. My student ID is s3926977. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City. This is my first semester at RMIT University as a first-year student. I can speak Vietnamese, English. I am not a sporty person and I rarely do sports. However, I can play table tennis as it was compulsory in my secondary school. I love reading, from novels to articles or interesting facts about the world around us. My free time is spent learning new skills, especially new languages. I am interested in AI when talking about my favorite field of IT. I have participated in some competitions, such as the WRO or the Arduino competition between high schools in HCMC.
